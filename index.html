              <h3>What is Ecological Farming?</h3>
              <p>In simple terms, ecological farming is like working in harmony with nature to grow food in a way that's good for the environment, the plants, and the people who eat the food. It's about using natural methods instead of chemicals, and being mindful of the whole ecosystem on the farm.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="column">
              <h3>How does Ecological Framing help the environment?</h3>
              <p>Ecological farming benefits the environment by avoiding harmful chemicals, preventing pollution, maintaining soil health, and promoting biodiversity. It also reduces carbon emissions through local and seasonal production. This approach supports a balanced and resilient ecosystem while providing nutritious food sustainably.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="column">
              <h3>Why does organic cost more?</h3>
              <p>The cost of organic food is higher than that of conventional food because the organic price tag more closely reflects the true cost of growing the food: substituting labor and intensive management for chemicals. These costs may include cleanup of polluted water and remediation of pesticide contamination.</p>
