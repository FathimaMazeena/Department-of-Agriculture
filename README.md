# Department-of-Agriculture
This project, developed as part of the Web Application Development module assignment, marks a significant milestone in my journey as my first full-stack web application.

The website was created for the Department of Agriculture to serve stakeholders in promoting sustainable agricultural development in Sri Lanka, ensuring food and nutrition security through ecological farming.

Key features include online service registration, query submission related to ecological farming, and admin functionalities to manage registered users and queries.

The website was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, with PHP handling the back-end logic.
